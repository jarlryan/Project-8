# Project-8
This program replicates a library of books, using two cpp files (mp8bookDriver.cpp and book.cpp) with a header file (book.h) containing a class for books, and accepts three input files: (mp8book.txt, to test the book class), (mp8bookarray.txt, containing a list of books in the library), and (mp8bookISBN.txt, containing a list of ISBN numbers to search the library of books for). The program utilizes the book class to print out a test of the class on a sample set of data, prints out the library of books, then searches the library by ISBN and prints out which books were found in the library and which books were not found to an output file (mp8output.txt).
